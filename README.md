# Loan Request Application
This project is based on the EMI calculator. Once the user entered the amount, interest rate and the loan term, the user can either 
* view the calculated capital amount, interest and the loan installment per month or
* the user can request a loan. Once the user request a loan, an email will be sent to the user confirming the request and the request details will be displayed in the next page.
